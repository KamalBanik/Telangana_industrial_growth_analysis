JOIN investments i ON d.dist_code = i.dist_code

GROUP BY d.district

ORDER BY 2 DESC

LIMIT 5;

   #### List down the bottom 5 districts that have attracted the least investments during FY 2019 to 2022:

SELECT d.District, ROUND(SUM(i.investment_in_cr), 2) AS Total_investment_in_Cr

FROM dim_districts d

JOIN investments i ON d.dist_code = i.dist_code

GROUP BY d.district

ORDER BY 2

LIMIT 5;
